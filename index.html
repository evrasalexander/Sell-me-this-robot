Imagine if you will, a world assisted and aided by personal robot companions. Sounds like something out of science fiction right? well in 2022 science fiction becomes reality with the new Tesla Bot personal robotic assistant!
    
    </p>

    <P class="p container">
      
Do you need help bringing groceries inside from your Tesla? Need help hanging a picture in your home? Not willing to put your faith in old outdated security equipment to monitor your home while you are away? You guessed it the Tesla Bot can do, and will do!
    
    </P>

    <p class="p container">

Worried about hostile robot takeovers like the one seen in the Sci-Fi thriller iRobot starring Will Smith? Have no fear as these robots are designed to be easily overpowered by the average adult in the event of massive robotic treason!

    <p class="p container">

Maybe you're just lonely and you wish to have a companion to do homework with or listen to music with, just to be around the home with you to keep you company. Choose from a wide array of different personality traits and fully customize not only the exterior design of your Tesla Bot but the internal character that makes each one so special!
